The project has been successfully built, and the `dist` folder has been created.

The deployment to GitHub Pages is typically handled by a GitHub Action as defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`. I have completed the local build steps (`npm install` and `npm run build`), which prepares the `dist` folder for deployment.

To complete the deployment to GitHub Pages, you would need to push these changes to the `main` branch, or manually trigger the workflow if it's configured for `workflow_dispatch`. I cannot directly perform the GitHub Pages deployment step.
